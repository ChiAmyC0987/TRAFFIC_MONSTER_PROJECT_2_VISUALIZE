# TRAFFIC_MONSTER_PROJECT_2_VISUALIZE
Dashboard and Visualization of Traffic Data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a continuation of Project 1 

Step 1: We pooled all our new work in the Project 1 repository and started to merge team work.

Step 2: To clean up, we moved only information related to dashboard to current repository.

Notes: To map some of SF data on google earth, we joined the CNNs of theme files with basemap CNN and Lat and Long. 
These databases were too big for Github and are stored on my local machines.
